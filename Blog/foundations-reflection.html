        <h2 class="green-text border">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
            <ul>
                <li>I’ve learnt that ego is a good thing to have as long as you keep it in check and don’t get too ahead of yourself.</li>
                <li>I’ve learnt that listening is an important skill that should be worked on consistently.</li>
                <li>I’ve learnt that learning styles change under different circumstances.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="green-text border">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p class="black-text">
            <ol>
                <li>Values – having good strong values will help a lot in this course, for me it will help keep me focused and driving towards something for the people I care about.</li>
                <li>Empathy – being able to empathise with your peers and team members allows you to be understanding and kind towards each other</li>
                <li>Self-awareness – being able to know how you feel when things get tough or when things are going well, so when things are hard you know what’s triggering and how to deal with it.</li>
            </ol>

        <h4 class="green-text border">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p class="black-text">
            I think what surprised me most about core is how important human skills are to becoming a developer.
        </p>

    <div class="silver-background">
        <h5 class="green-text border">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>
        <p class="black-text">
            Having to self asses is something I struggled with, having to really look inside yourself and evaluate how you really think
             and feel.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="silver-background">
        <h6 class="green-text border">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h6>
        <p class="black-text">
            Because web development isn’t just a one person job, it means working in a team and even a person with the best technical 
            skill is useless if they are unable to work and collaborate in a good way with the team working on a project.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="silver-background">
        <h2 class="green-text border">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p class="black-text">
            No because I believe that self development is important in becoming a developer and also important in progressing through life.
