        <li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li>
        <p class="black-text">
          My 5 year plan is to finish my studies get a internship within
          development, from there the progression at a steady rate should be
          junior-intermediate-senior developer. If possible I am wanting to go
          through this processes at a faster rate and hopefully be there within
          3 years. If I am able to do that I would want to progress further
          within my career

          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </li>
        <p>
          One strength I have to learning is being a very fast learner and my
          ability to pick up and understand different content. I have always
          been very quick to learn especially when it is challenging and
          interesting. One limitation I have is when thing stop challenging me I
          get bored quickly and struggle to stay focused on the task.
        </p>
        <li>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </li>
        <p>
          I would like to develop more on my confidence with group
          conversations. One on one im very strong and being able to communicate
          confidently but in a group situation I tend to step back and let
          others take control
        </p>
        <li>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </li>
        <p>
          I will do my best to work co-operatively with others, whether its
          working via zoom or occasionally going in and working side by side
          with my peers. The best way I would do that is to get to know them
          personally as I feel it would be the best way to work together. when
          things are building up I will either reach out to family or peers and
          try to talk about whats building up and how to cope or I will reach
          out to a Facilitator and ask for support or help into an avenue I
          could get the support needed.
        </p>
        <li>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </li>
        <p>
          A commitment I will make to asking for help in a timely way is setting
          up habits where I will spend a maximum of a hour and half of being
          stuck and trying to work it out myself I will the reach out to my
          fellow students and if they cant help then reach out to a member of
          the teaching team.
        </p>
        <li>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li>
        <p>
          To allow me the best way to learn everything I need to, to be in the
          best possible position once I graduate.
        </p>
        <li>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </li>
        <p>
          I have a great support system where if I am unable to pick up my son I
          can depend on my family to support me during this time of study.

        <li>
          What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </li>
        <p>
          My 5 year goal/career pathway is to become a senior developer. I’m wanting to work my way through the stages of junior to 
          intermediate to senior developer.
        </p>
        <li>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </li>
        <p>
           My biggest strength is that I am a fast learner and I am able to focus and preform under pressure. My biggest limitation 
           is my time arrangement and occasional lack of focus. 
        </p>
        <li>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </li>
        <p>
          I think my biggest challenge will be to balance my work life with my Taha Whanau. I have always prioritised my duty to provide.
        </p>
        <li>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
       </li>
       <p>
         I would really like to work on my confidence and ability to talk in groups. I find it to be a weak point in my life. 
         As I normally always tend to stand back and let others take lead.
      </p>
        <li>
          What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
        </li>
        <p>
          I’m expecting bootcamp to be very full on and a close experience to what actual work would be like. I feel that 
          it would be a great experience and a good test of character and willingness to finish what has been started.
        </p>
        <li>
          What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
        </li>
        <p>
          I hope that I am able to keep up and pass this course. I expect myself to do everything that is needed to pass this course.
        </p>
