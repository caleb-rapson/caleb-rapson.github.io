      <h2 class="green-text border">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p class="black-text">Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand and manage your own emotions as well as being able to understand and influence the emotions of others. It involves being aware that emotions drive behaviours and impact people either positively or negatively. According to Peter Salovey and John Mayer, emotional intelligence is "the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behaviour. Psychologist and author Daniel Goleman defines the five key elements of EI as:
        <ol>
          <li>Self-awareness- If youâ€™re self- aware, you understand your emotions and their triggers. You also know how your emotions and actions affect those around you.</li>
          <li>Self-regulation- Self-regulation is the ability to control and adjust your emotions to create a more positive effect. Being in control of your feelings is essential in any situation because your emotions have a strong effect on other people.</li>
          <li>Motivation- Motivation is the desire to do something. It relates to emotional intelligence because your desires can promote different feelings toward something.</li>
          <li>Empathy- Empathy allows you to identify and understand the feelings of others, which may help you to handle workplace situations more effectively. For instance, when a coworker is visibly stressed, you can react with empathy.</li>
          <li>Social skills- Social skills are tools you use to communicate and interact with others. Having strong social skills allows you to listen, speak and resolve conflicts more effectively. Social skills can be used in the workplace to develop your career and are essential tools for leaders.</li>
        </ol>

      <h3 class="green-text border">How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
      <p class="black-text">IQ- Intelligence quotient, or IQ, is a number used to express a person's overall mental ability. This score is derived from a standardized test.
        On the original IQ tests, scores were calculated by dividing the individual's mental age by chronological age and multiplying that number by 100. A child with a mental age of 15 and a chronological age of 10 would have an IQ of 150.
        Today, scores on most IQ tests are calculated by comparing the test taker's score to the average scores of other people in the same age group. IQ represents abilities such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
          <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
          <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
          <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
          <li> Quantitative reasoning</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>EQ- Emotional intelligence refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.
          Researchers such as John Mayer and Peter Salovey, as well as writers like Daniel Goleman, have helped shine a light on emotional intelligence, making it a hot topic in areas ranging from business management to education.2 EQ is centred on abilities such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Identifying emotions</li>
          <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
          <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
          <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
          <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication.</li>
          <li>Relating to others</li>
        </ul>  
        </p>

      <h4 class="green-text border">Why is EQ important?</h4>
      <p>It can assist you in building stronger relationships, achieving success at school and work, and achieving your career and personal goals. It helps you connect with your feelings, act on your intentions, and make informed decisions regarding your personal goals. Emotional intelligence facilitates our capacity for resilience, motivation, empathy, reasoning, stress management, communication, and our ability to read and navigate a plethora of social situations and conflicts
