  <title>Neuroplasticity</title>
  <h1 id="myheading" class="purple-text">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h1>

        Neuroplasticity – or brain plasticity – is the ability of the brain to modify its connections or re-wire
        itself. Without this ability, any brain, not just the human brain, would be unable to develop from infancy 
        through to adulthood or recover from brain injury. What makes the brain special is that, unlike a computer, 
        it processes sensory and motor signals in parallel. It has many neural pathways that can replicate another’s 
        function so that small errors in development or temporary loss of function through damage can be easily corrected 
        by rerouting signals along a different pathway. 
    </P>
    <P>Some principles are:
      <ul>
        <li>Use it or lose it: old brain pathways that are no longer in use are “pruned away”.</li>
        <li>Use it and improve it: the brain can improve with practice.</li>
        <li>Specificity: the brain can only improve on what it is trained on.</li>
        <li>Salience matters: the brain pays more attention to things that are important.</li>
        <li>Transference: the brain can transfer learning from one task to another.</li>
    </ul>
    </P>
<P>Some of the benefits of neuroplasticity are:
    <ul>
        <li>It enables learning and memory.</li>
        <li>It enhances cognitive capabilities.</li>
        <li>It allows recovery from strokes and brain injuries.</li>
        <li>It strengthens areas where function is lost or declined.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="green-text border">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use it and improve it – This is one of the principles I may engage with as pathways have already been
                created on how basics of how to use a computer or how to do research. By constantly doing research for
                our core subjects we are strengthening our ability to do this more efficiently and accurately. Same goes
                for coding, the more we do it and the more time we spend learning and developing these skills the stronger 
                the pathways link in our brains.
            </li>
            <li>
                Salience matters – By constantly making my study a priority and constantly thinking about it when I’m not
                studying i.e. “how could I have improved on my timing last week”. The brain recognises the importance of 
                needing to do the work and to prioritise my study.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transference – Our core tasks are especially transferrable as they can be applied to almost any real life 
                situation and can also be transferred back from any previous experience one has had in life.
            </li>

    <h3 class="green-text border">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>
        Some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity is by engaging in positive social interactions, learning a new 
        skill or practicing mindfulness and meditation.

    <h4 class="green-text border">Discuss what is Growth mindset and why it is relevant</h4>
    <p>
        Growth mindset is a belief that intelligence can be developed through effort and experience. It is the opposite of
        fixed mindset, which is the belief that intelligence is static. People with a growth mindset embrace challenges and
        persist even when it’s hard. It is relevant to this type of study as coding is constantly changing and developing and 
        if you were to have a fixed mindset you wouldn’t be able to adjust and adapt to the work. Also the growth mindset allows
        you to preserver even when its hard which is needed as this type of study is constantly getting harder and more complex as
        the weeks progress.

    <h5 class="green-text border">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h5>
    <p>
        No, “growth mindset” has many different versions and is used in many different ways in life. It is something that I have
        been studying and learning for myself for the last few months. The understanding of some of the different parts of “growth
        mindset” has actually helped me to beat my clinical depression.
    </p>

<div class="silver-background">
    <h6 class="green-text border">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h6>
    <p>
        For me I have already integrated it in to my learning from the start, it is something that I have used to keep me going
        when I’ve felt like it was to hard.
