          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

          When working as a plumber I knew an apprentice that was under
          preforming, all the trades-men and even the project managers were
          telling me he was “useless” and “lazy”. Rather then listen to them and
          base my judgment of this person off theirs I spent sometime with him
          and got to know him personally. What I had found out was that he
          hadn’t lived a easy life and was used to being judged off the colour
          of his skin. Something I myself have experienced. Because of the
          relevance his story had to mine I decided to help him the best way I
          could by explaining what everyone else was saying about him and
          pushing him to be better. I look back and I’m glad I tried to help him
          in that situation because I remember when I felt how he did and I had
          to learn the hard way. I’m glad I was able to help him.

          2. Describe how your culture and how the people around you have
          influenced your values and identity.
        </li>
        <p>
          My culture is Samoan. It is a big part and definitely shaped who I am.
          My culture is big on respect, it feels as if its something that is
          engrained in you from the moment you’re born. We believe that we
          should respect each other, respect all around even those that may not
          give you the same respect back. But most importantly we are taught to
          respect your elders. That could be your boss, grandparents, but above
          all your parents as they are the ones that gave you life, they’re the
          ones that would sacrifice anything and everything for your well-being.
          I think due to the way I was raised one of the most important things
          to me is respect, it is something I give to any and everyone until it
          is abused. Being disrespected is something that hurts me deeply right
          to my very core.

          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </li>
        One of my strengths is my firm belief that no matter what it is if I put
        my mind to it there is nothing I cannot accomplish. I believe that if
        its been done before why cant I. I believe this knowledge I have within
        myself will benefit my learning as anytime it gets hard I will always
        perserver
        <li>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </li>
        <p>
          One of my limitations is being a father, it limits the amount of time
          I can dedicate to my learning as I have responsibility over his life
          and prioritise his need for a father over anything else.

          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </li>
        <p>
          Being brown and in the trade can be quite difficult. I experienced a
          lot of prejudice culture. I was immediately judged by my skin rather
          then my ability from a lot of the older generation that had been in
          the trade for most of their life. One strategy I tried was to just put
          my head down and work as hard as I could to be the best at my job.
          While that worked it took along time for them to notice and in some
          cases they wouldn’t notice at all. So I tried another strategy which
          was to find common ground. My ability to relate to most people helped
          me greatly. This worked a lot faster as humans are emotional creatures
          by nature, so by being able to connect with them on a basic emotional
          level would change their perception of me.
