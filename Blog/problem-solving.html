        In sprint one I got stuck with pushing one of my HTML projects. I was stuck for awhile wondering why it wasn’t going through.
        I re read all the code, went through the lessons again and went through the tech chat to see if anyone else had a similar 
        experience. But that didn’t work. I was getting extremely frustrated until I asked on of my peers to have a look at what the 
        problem could be. At first glance he saw the problem was that I had spelt html wrong. Once we had found the problem the 
        solution was easy and I felt so relieved and embarrassed at the same time. I learnt that I should always double check my 
        spelling.

        In sprint 4 I was stuck on the “Fizzbuzz” function for a while. I went over lessons to try and work it out. I managed to 
        fill out most of the function but it still wasn’t working. I was getting frustrated and felt like giving up. I then took 
        a short break and when I came back I went through the tech-questions and luckily others had a similar experience. I then 
        found the solution through the chat and checking their code against mine.	 I learnt to not give up and when it is getting 
        hard sometimes a short break to re-assess the problem with a fresher mind can make a big difference.

    <h4 class="green-text border">Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h4>
    <p class="black-text">
        <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode – I am good with pseudocode asa it is comments from myself or other coders explaining what to do or what is done</li>
            <li>Trying something – I am confident with trying something as if I have done it wrong the first time I will immediately try another way myself before reaching out for help</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method – I think the rubber ducky method is okay as I generally do it in my head but as of yet have not tried it written.</li>
            <li>Reading error messages – I’m happy with reading error messages as they normally tell me what line the code is failing and where to go over my code.</li>
            <li>Console.logging – I am confident with consol.logging as it tells you if the code has worked or not.</li>
            <li>Googling – I am confident in googling as you can get directed to a deeper learning or understanding from a different lesson perspective</li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help – I am reasonably confident when it comes to asking my peers as we are all on the same page and are all learning and learn in different ways and see things in different perspectives.</li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help – I am not overly confident in asking coaches for help as I feel the need to impress them over takes the need for asking for help</li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection – I enjoy looking back and reflecting on problems ive had as it makes me feel confident in my ability to not give up.</li>
        </ul>
