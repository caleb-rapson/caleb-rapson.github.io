        <h2 class="green-text border">Taha tinana (physical wellbeing)</h2>
        <p>
            I believe that Taha tinana is the first building block to being a better and stronger person. As I believe that a strong 
            body will always equal a strong mind. Looking after your body wether through physical exercise or through well balanced 
            nourishment. It is the first place to start working on yourself and building a better person. My plan for Tah tinana is to 
            go to the gym a minimum of once a day, eat the correct food for my bodys nutritional health and to go for multiple walks
            either first thing in the morning or anytime i feel overwhelmed and need to refresh my mind.

        <h3 class="green-text border">Taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</h3>
        <p class="black-text">
            I think Taha Hinengaro is the next step to becoming a better person. As when you start training and looking after your body 
            it releases endorphins which reduce stress and increase your sense of well-being. I think Taha Hinengaro is extremely 
            important to a persons well-being as its been proven time and time again that the mind can dictate the direction of your 
            life. A bad mind set can lead to a bad life or worse. But a good strong mindset can keep someone going even when life is at 
            its hardest. My plan for working on Taha Hinengaro will be to listen to guided meditations before I go to sleep and first 
            thing in the morning. I have also set up my social media account on TikTok to be full of influential and positive 
            reinforcements for a strong mindset.

        <h4 class="purple-text border">Taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</h4>
        <p class="black-text">
            I believe that the next step after physical and mental will come Taha Wairua. I believe that once you have created good 
            habits to increase your physical and mental well being you then start to focus on your soul. I think that Taha Wairua is 
            extremely important as you now start to use the work you did inside your own body and mind and start to project it outwards.
            Whether that’s through prayer and gratitude to those around you or working on healing your soul through kind actions towards
            others. My plan is to continue my prayers of gratitude for the life and family I’ve been blessed with and to continue to be 
            a part of the charitable organisation that myself and a few good men have started to try and better the lives of men going 
            through a similar struggle to ourselves.

        <h5 class="purple-text border">Taha whānau (family wellbeing)</h5>
        <p class="black-text">
            I believe Taha Whānau is something as humans we never stop working on. Family is something that is deeply biologically 
            engrained in to each of us. We start with the family that brought us into the world then we work on building our own 
            families using or sometimes not using the building blocks that were passed down to us generation after generation. Taha 
            Whānau for me is a part of my very core. It is something I was raised to believe is the most important thing and the only 
            thing we truly have in this life. My plan to work on Taha Whānau is to continue my Sunday family dinners and to continue 
            building and working on my relationships. Especially to my kids and being the best father I can be.

        <h6>Whenua/Final Thoughs</h6>
        <p class="black-text">
            I believe that energy cannot be created or destroyed therefor I believe that from the ground we are given life and to the 
            ground we shall return. Whenua is the start and the end of all life. It is the single most amazing gift we are given. My 
            plan is to walk in to the ocean once a week and feel the sand and waves against my feet. Where water and earth meet is 
            where I find the most peace in this world.
        </p>
        <p class="black-text">
            I believe that all are important and all are connected. From connecting and strengthening within yourself to connecting 
            to the world and holy spirit around us. All are connected in infinite ways and to work on one means to work on all. By 
            having the connection to yourself and the world you become a fuller and better person.
